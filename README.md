# Elepower
A new *powerful* modpack for [Minetest](http://minetest.net)!

**I do not recommend using this modpack with technic or pipeworks, as this modpack aims to become the all-in-one solution. However, compatibility might be added at a later date.**

## Features

### Universal Electric Power API
How is this any different from technic I hear you asking? Well, first of all, I have eliminated the concept of "tiers" in the **technic** sense, as all types of machines will now be accepting any conduit. Machines can be upgraded for speed and efficiency.

### (Planned) Universal Fluid Transfer API
Exactly what it sounds like. Pipeworks failed to do this.

### (Planned) Universal Item Transfer API
Also exactly what it sounds like. /might/ be backwards-compatible with pipeworks, currently undecided.

### Machinery
Machines for doubling your ore output and helping you create more powerful materials.

### Tools
Powered tools that you can simply recharge instead of crafting them again.

### (Planned) Farming
Farming automation machines.

### (Planned) Nuclear
Nuclear power. Both fission and fusion will be presented!
